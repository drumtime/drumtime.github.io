    <h3>Device Support</h3>
    <p>DrumTime listens to MIDI input, so it works with any MIDI-enabled instrument. If your device supports MIDI over USB you can plug it in directly; if not, you can use a MIDI to USB interface cable.</p>

    <h3>Very Low Latency</h3>
    <p>Tapping directly into the advanced audio features of Mac OS, DrumTime was designed with low latency in mind. With a good cable, latency is  below 10ms. Learn more about latency <a href='#experiment'>here</a>.</p>

      <h1>Simply hook up your MIDI-enabled device</h1>
      <p>
        DrumTime will automatically detect MIDI devices connected to your Mac - including software devices. You can even use more than one at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the metronome sound will play from your Mac, you have several options to hear all sounds from the same speaker or headphone.
        <ul>
          <li>You can use the audio-out of your kit or device and connect it to your Mac. </li>
          <li>If your kit or device has an audio-in you can connect the audio-out of your Mac to your device.</li>
          <li>You can use some software on your Mac to generate the sounds for your kit or device</li>

      <h1>Taking Latency Seriously</h1>
      <p>
          To ensure minimal latency we put our app to the test. We created a setup that allows DrumTime to 'march' to its own drum, literally!
      </p>
      <p>
          Our test rig consisted of a common electronic drum sensor (a piezo element, if you're curious) attached to a speaker and connected to a drum computer. When the metronome is played in DrumTime, it causes the speaker to vibrate, triggering the sensor and thereby simulating a drum being hit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we knew down to the millisecond when each click should be played, we were able measure the time between the click and when the sensor sent a MIDI signal back to the app. We found this delay to be highly consistent at just below 10ms.

          <h1>Easy to Use and Configurable</h1>
          <p>
              Besides allowing you to configure tracks to match your kit or device, DrumTime's interface lets you focus on practicing. Hit the spacebar to start and stop playing. An optional count-in gives you time to get set.
          </p>
          <p>
            Naturally, you can adjust the tempo, either by typing in the exact BPM or by simply scrolling. Also choose from a wide variety of time signatures - how about broadening your repertoire by tackling 13/8 time? If you get stuck, there is always the built-in help function and tutorial to fall back on.
